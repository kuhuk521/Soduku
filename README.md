# Soduku

## Through this program one can solve soduku in seconds.

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Concept used in Backtracking:-
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

The user just have to enter values of a 9X9 grid. The values have to be in the range of 0-9 only.
In the places where 0 is present, a value in the range of 1-9 is found satisfying the constraints of a soduku.
