# Soduku 

## Through this program one can solve soduku in seconds.

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a :nine: × :nine: grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine :three: × :three: subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Concept used in Backtracking:-
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

The user just have to enter values of a 9 X 9 grid. The values have to be in the range of :zero: to :nine: only.
In the places where :zero: is present, a value in the range of :one: to :nine: is found satisfying the constraints of a soduku.
